## Project Goals

Create a movie booking website with the following features:

- User Registration
- Movie selection
- Seat booking
- Payment options

Utilize any available free API for retrieving movie data.

Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a MongoDB database for movies, users, and bookings.

Use Express.js and Node.js for server-side operations and API routing.

Implement React for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

Ensure the application is well-structured, secure, and scalable.

### Key Features

- User registration and login (authentication)
- Movie list with details such as title, description, rating, and showtimes
- Movie search functionality based on title, genre, or other criteria
- Movie seat booking and reservation
- User account management, including booking history and profile updates
- Admin panel for managing movies, showtimes, and user accounts
- Payment gateway integration for processing payments
